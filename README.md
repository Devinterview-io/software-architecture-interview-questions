The most common and simple load balancing algorithm is Round Robin. In this type of load balancing the request is divided in circular order ensuring all machines get equal number of requests and no single machine is overloaded or underloaded.  </p><p><strong>The Purpose of load balancing is to</strong>  </p><ul><li>Optimize resource usage (avoid overload and under-load of any machines)</li><li>Achieve Maximum Throughput</li><li>Minimize response time</li></ul><p><strong>Most common load balancing techniques in web based applications are</strong>  </p><ol><li>Round robin</li><li>Session affinity or sticky session</li><li>IP Address affinity</li></ol></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.fromdev.com/2013/07/architect-interview-questions-and-answers.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What Is Load Balancing?

What Is CAP Theorem?</h2></div> <div data-v-4865b274=""><h3 data-v-4865b274="">Answer:</h3> <div data-v-4865b274=""><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><strong>The CAP Theorem for distributed computing</strong> was published by Eric Brewer. This states that it is not possible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:  </p><ol><li><em>Consistency</em> (all nodes see the same data even at the same time with concurrent updates )</li><li><em>Availability</em> (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it was successful or failed)</li><li><em>Partition tolerance</em> (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system)</li></ol><p>The CAP acronym corresponds to these three guarantees. This theorem has created the base for modern distributed computing approaches. Worlds most high volume traffic companies (e.g. Amazon, Google, Facebook) use this as basis for deciding their application architecture. It's important to understand that only two of these three conditions can be guaranteed to be met by a system.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.fromdev.com/2013/07/architect-interview-questions-and-answers.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What Is CAP Theorem?

That continuous connection allows the following:</p><ol><li><p>Data can be sent from server to client at any time, without the client even requesting it. This is often called server-push and is very valuable for applications where the client needs to know fairly quickly when something happens on the server (like a new chat messages has been received or a new price has been udpated). A client cannot be pushed data over http. The client would have to regularly poll by making an http request every few seconds in order to get timely new data. Client polling is not efficient.</p></li><li><p>Data can be sent either way very efficiently.

As it applies to webSockets, it just means that data can be sent quicker (particularly over slow links) because the connection has already been established so no extra packet roundtrips are required to establish the TCP connection.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44898882/why-to-use-websocket-and-what-is-the-advantage-of-using-it" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What do you mean by lower latency interaction?

What Is Scalability?</h2></div> <div data-v-4865b274=""><h3 data-v-4865b274="">Answer:</h3> <div data-v-4865b274=""><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of load by adding more resources. The adding of resource can be done in two ways  </p><ul><li><strong>Scaling Up</strong><br>This involves adding more resources to the existing nodes. For example, adding more RAM, Storage or processing power.</li><li><strong>Scaling Out</strong><br>This involves adding more nodes to support more users.</li></ul><p>Any of the approaches can be used for scaling up/out a application, however the cost of adding resources (per user) may change as the volume increases. If we add resources to the system It should increase the ability of application to take more load in a proportional manner of added resources.  </p><p>An ideal application should be able to serve high level of load in less resources. However, in practical, linearly scalable system may be the best option achievable. Poorly designed applications may have really high cost on scaling up/out since it will require more resources/user as the load increases.<br>  </p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.fromdev.com/2013/07/architect-interview-questions-and-answers.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What Is Scalability?

Why Do You Need Clustering?</h2></div> <div data-v-4865b274=""><h3 data-v-4865b274="">Answer:</h3> <div data-v-4865b274=""><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><em>Clustering</em> is needed for achieving high availability for a server software. The main purpose of clustering is to achieve 100% availability or a zero down time in service. A typical server software can be running on one computer machine and it can serve as long as there is no hardware failure or some other failure. By creating a cluster of more than one machine, we can reduce the chances of our service going un-available in case one of the machine fails.  </p><p>Doing clustering does not always guarantee that service will be 100% available since there can still be a chance that all the machine in a cluster fail at the same time. However it in not very likely in case you have many machines and they are located at different location or supported by their own resources.<br>  </p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.fromdev.com/2013/07/architect-interview-questions-and-answers.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Why Do You Need Clustering?

The system needs to be scalable to allow it to benefit from the dynamic addition, or removal, of resources at runtime. Elasticity therefore builds upon scalability and expands on it by adding the notion of automatic resource management.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is Elasticity (in contrast to Scalability)?
